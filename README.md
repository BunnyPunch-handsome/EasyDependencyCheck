# EasyDependencyChick
EasyDependencyCheck is a script based on the open-source project [Dependency Check](https://github.com/jeremylong/DependencyCheck). This script aims to simplify the usage of Dependency Check for vulnerability scanning, especially for those who have limited internet access for pulling the NVD database or find Dependency Check challenging to use.

You can read about the\n        hundreds of pitfalls for unwary developers on the OWASP website. By\n        providing developers with a set of strong controls, we aim to\n        eliminate some of the complexity of creating secure web applications.\n        This can result in significant cost savings across the SDLC.","reference":"https://ossindex.sonatype.org/component/pkg:maven/org.owasp.esapi/esapi@2.5.3.0?utm_source\u003ddependency-check\u0026utm_medium\u003dintegration\u0026utm_content\u003d11.1.0","vulnerabilities":[],"sonatypeOssiScore":0.0}

In XStream before version 1.4.16, there is a vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to load and execute arbitrary code from a remote host only by manipulating the processed input stream. No user is affected, who followed the recommendation to setup XStream\u0027s security framework with a whitelist limited to the minimal required types. If you rely on XStream\u0027s default blacklist of the Security Framework, you will have to use at least version 1.4.16.","cvssScore":9.1,"cvssVector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H","cwe":"CWE-434","cve":"CVE-2021-21351","reference":"https://ossindex.sonatype.org/vulnerability/CVE-2021-21351?component-type\u003dmaven\u0026component-name\u003dcom.thoughtworks.xstream%2Fxstream\u0026utm_source\u003ddependency-check\u0026utm_medium\u003dintegration\u0026utm_content\u003d11.1.0","externalReferences":["http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId\u003dCVE-2021-21351","https://x-stream.github.io/CVE-2021-21351.html"]},{"id":"CVE-2021-43859","displayName":"CVE-2021-43859","title":"[CVE-2021-43859] CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (\u0027Resource Exhaustion\u0027)","description":"XStream is an open source java library to serialize objects to XML and back again.

Versions prior to 1.4.20 may allow a remote attacker to terminate the application with a stack overflow error, resulting in a denial of service only via manipulation the processed input stream. The attack uses the hash code implementation for collections and maps to force recursive hash calculation causing a stack overflow. This issue is patched in version 1.4.20 which handles the stack overflow and raises an InputManipulationException instead. A potential workaround for users who only use HashMap or HashSet and whose XML refers these only as default map or set, is to change the default implementation of java.util.Map and java.util per the code example in the referenced advisory. However, this implies that your application does not care about the implementation of the map and all elements are comparable.","cvssScore":7.5,"cvssVector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","cwe":"CWE-120","cve":"CVE-2022-41966","reference":"https://ossindex.sonatype.org/vulnerability/CVE-2022-41966?component-type\u003dmaven\u0026component-name\u003dcom.thoughtworks.xstream%2Fxstream\u0026utm_source\u003ddependency-check\u0026utm_medium\u003dintegration\u0026utm_content\u003d11.1.0","externalReferences":["http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId\u003dCVE-2022-41966","https://x-stream.github.io/CVE-2022-41966.html","https://gitee.com/src-openeuler/xstream/issues/I67B9Q","https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/security/advisories/GHSA-j563-grx4-pjpv"]},{"id":"CVE-2024-47072","displayName":"CVE-2024-47072","title":"[CVE-2024-47072] CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow","description":"XStream is a simple library to serialize objects to XML and back again.
